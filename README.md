# Customer-Data-Analysis
Data Analytics Project: End-to-End Analysis & Dashboarding
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to actionable insights through visualization. The objective is to analyze a dataset using Python and SQL, clean and prepare the data, and finally present insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The project showcases practical skills in data analysis, data cleaning, SQL querying, and business intelligence reporting, making it suitable for academic, portfolio, or entry-level data analyst roles.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
MySQL (Data storage & querying)
Power BI (Data visualization & dashboarding)
Jupyter Notebook
SQL

📂 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading
Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas.
Inspected data structure, columns, and data types.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed data distributions and trends.
Identified missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Used visualizations to understand relationships between variables.

3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing and inconsistent values.
Removed duplicates and corrected data types.
Prepared clean, structured data for analysis and SQL operations.

4️⃣ SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Imported cleaned data into a MySQL database.
Wrote SQL queries to:
Perform aggregations and filtering
Analyze trends and key metrics
Extract insights for reporting

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Connected Power BI to MySQL / processed dataset.
Created interactive dashboards with:
KPIs and summary metrics
Trend analysis
Filters and slicers for dynamic exploration

📈 Key Insights
Identified meaningful patterns and trends in the data.
Highlighted business-relevant metrics through SQL queries.
Delivered insights visually for better decision-making.
